# StegoVoice: AI-Powered Secure Audio Messaging

StegoVoice is an AI-based voice steganography application that allows users to encrypt text messages into natural-sounding speech and later decrypt them back into the original message using ElevenLabs APIs.

This tool is designed for offline-capable secure communication. It uses randomized encryption mappings, realistic voice synthesis, and reliable speech-to-text transcription â€” all wrapped in a simple desktop GUI.

## Features

- Converts secret text into human-like audio using ElevenLabs TTS
- Recovers original message via speech-to-text transcription
- Auto-deletes audio and key files after a short delay
- Access control via hardcoded authorized users
- No backend or server: all operations are local
- Tkinter-based GUI with options for encryption and decryption
- Modular file structure for easy maintenance and scaling

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Add your ElevenLabs API key inside the tts_converter.py and decryptor.py files.  
3. Run main.py to start the application.  
4. Log in using a predefined username and password from credentials.py.  
5. Choose to encrypt or decrypt a message.  
6. After encryption, the audio file is generated and saved temporarily.  
7. After decryption, the audio is transcribed and the original text is shown.  
8. All files are auto-deleted after 30 seconds for security.
